										When people decide if they trust and respect us, they’re implicitly assessing whether they

										we have their best interest at heart: that we’re kind, decent, and moral. Whether we’re seen as
										competent depends on whether people think we can actually accomplish what we set out to do: our
										ability to “get the job done.” When people think we’re warm and competent, they feel good about
										us too. They find us inspiring and praiseworthy. When they think we’re lacking in warmth
										or judgment, they feel angry, envious, or fearful. So, if you want to increase the chances that
										your behavior will be perceived as courageous and worth doing something about, work consistently
										to establish your warmth and competence in the minds of others. Consider two examples from the
										same organization, where both employees were seen as competent but only one was perceived as warm.
										Zak, a sales representative, spoke up about the problems with the company’s compensation policy.
										The issues he pointed out were legitimate, but Zak’s reputation of selfishness overshadowed the
										validity of his points and no changes were made. Conversely, Frank, another sales representative,
										was known to be highly committed to customer service in ways that built loyalty to the firm. He,
										too, spoke up about things like the need to improve after-hours service calls. Even though he
										wasn’t any more skilled in his approach than Zak, managers knew that Frank’s heart was in the
										right place and thus labeled him courageous rather than insubordinate, and applied real effort
										to address the issues he raised.

										we have their best interest at heart: that we’re kind, decent, and moral. Whether we’re seen as
										competent depends on whether people think we can actually accomplish what we set out to do: our
										ability to “get the job done.” When people think we’re warm and competent, they feel good about
										us too. They find us inspiring and praiseworthy. When they think we’re lacking in warmth
										or judgment, they feel angry, envious, or fearful. So, if you want to increase the chances that

										too, spoke up about things like the need to improve after-hours service calls. Even though he
										wasn’t any more skilled in his approach than Zak, managers knew that Frank’s heart was in the

					<h3>3. Manage the Moment</h3>
					<div class="main-text">
						<p>
							People who fare well “in the moment” have often done lots of things ahead
							of time to increase the likelihood that their courageous act goes well.
							They’ve consistently demonstrated their competence and shown that they’re warm,
							emotionally intelligent, and fair. They’ve also increased the likelihood that
							they’ll be OK no matter how it goes by keeping their value high and dependence low.

								<p class="standfirst top-line">Building your internal reputation</p>
								<p>
									Before choosing courage in specific instances, it helps to have earned
									what psychologists call “idiosyncrasy credits” – a stock of goodwill
									garnered from previous actions that allow you to survive and even thrive
									when pushing boundaries. You build this type of strong internal
									reputation by consistently demonstrating “warmth” and “competence”
									– the two foundations of trust. One key to building trust is to be
									consistently fair, so that even those you’re challenging or seeking
									support from believe your intentions are good.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-6">
								<p class="standfirst top-line">Maximizing your autonomy</p>
								<p>
									Choosing courage is easier if you reduce the overall risks to yourself
									of others’ disapproval. You can do this by keeping your internal value
									and external mobility high. And you can make financial choices that
									lessen your fear of the consequences of taking risks. You can also
									foster a broad base of social support and personal well-being so you’re
									less concerned about others’ approval at work. Collectively, these actions
									help you feel less dependent on your specific boss or employer, and thus
									support taking prudent risks for worthy causes.
